- 👋 Hi, I’m @nfthypetrain
- 👀 I’m interested in building a community around the launch of the NFT Hype Machine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NFTs and Professional Networking
- 📫 How to reach me: https://linktr.ee/NftHypeTrain
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on launching an NFT.
  I have a vision, which I will expand on in a revision.
    For now I'll just say that I know I cannot succeed alone.
    I need to cultivate a community of artists, developers,
    influencers, and fans in order to make my vision a reality.
